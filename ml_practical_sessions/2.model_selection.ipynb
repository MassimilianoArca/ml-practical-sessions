In principle, we would have to train $\\binom{9}{k}$ models, one for each $k \\in \\{ 1, ..., 9 \\}$, and to compare one model against the others. This sounds quite inefficient. Instead, we start from the complete set of features and we try to iteratively remove the least relevant feature. The relevance of a feature can be specified in different ways. For simple models like linear regression, usually the one with the coefficient with the highest p-value is removed. We stop when there are no features with a p-value > 0.5."
