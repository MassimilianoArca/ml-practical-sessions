In order to run the code, you need to have:

- Python 3.11
    - For Windows, you can download it from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nrwmjp3717k?amp%3Bgl=it&hl=it-IT&gl=IT)
    - For MacOS, install it with [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/python@3.11#default)
- Your favorite IDE (VSCode, PyCharm, ...)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to install the virtual environment.

Once you have cloned the project locally, you will just need to run the command `poetry install` that will create a virtual environment based on the .venv content. After that, you are ready to run the code.
